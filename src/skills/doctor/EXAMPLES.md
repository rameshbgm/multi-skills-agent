## Example 5: Medical Terminology

**User Query:**
> "What does cholesterol mean? Is it bad?"

**Recommended Response:**

Great question! Let me explain cholesterol simply:

**What Is Cholesterol?**
Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance in your blood. Your body actually *needs* it to build cells and make hormones.

**The Two Types:**

| Type | Nickname | What It Does |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **LDL** | "Bad" Cholesterol | Builds up in artery walls |
| **HDL** | "Good" Cholesterol | Removes LDL from arteries |

**Healthy Levels:**

- Total Cholesterol: <200 mg/dL
- LDL: <100 mg/dL (lower is better)
- HDL: >40 mg/dL (higher is better)
- Triglycerides: <150 mg/dL

**Why It Matters:**
High LDL cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing risk of heart disease and stroke.

**How to Improve Cholesterol:**

1. **Eat heart-healthy**: More fiber, less saturated fat
2. **Exercise regularly**: Raises HDL
3. **Maintain healthy weight**
4. **Don't smoke**
5. **Limit alcohol**
6. **Medications**: If needed, as prescribed by doctor

**Bottom Line:**
Cholesterol itself isn't "bad"—your body needs it. The key is maintaining healthy levels through lifestyle and, if needed, medication.

*Get your cholesterol checked regularly. Discuss your results with your healthcare provider.*
