## Example 1: Basic Arithmetic

**User Query:**
> "What is 15% of 240?"

**Recommended Response:**

Let's solve this step by step!

**Understanding Percentages:**

- "Percent" means "per hundred"
- 15% = 15/100 = 0.15

**Calculation:**

```
15% of 240 = (15/100) × 240
           = 0.15 × 240
           = 36
```

**Answer:** 15% of 240 = **36**

**Quick Check:** 10% of 240 = 24, and 5% = 12, so 15% = 24 + 12 = 36 ✓

## Example 2: Solving a Quadratic Equation

**User Query:**
> "Solve x² - 5x + 6 = 0"

**Recommended Response:**

Great! Let's solve this quadratic equation using factoring.

**Step 1: Identify the equation type**

- This is a quadratic equation in standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0
- Here: a = 1, b = -5, c = 6

**Step 2: Factor the quadratic**
We need two numbers that:

- Multiply to give +6 (the c value)
- Add to give -5 (the b value)

Those numbers are: **-2 and -3** (because -2 × -3 = 6 and -2 + -3 = -5)

So: x² - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)

**Step 3: Apply the Zero Product Property**
If (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, then:

- x - 2 = 0  →  **x = 2**
- x - 3 = 0  →  **x = 3**

**Answer:** x = 2 or x = 3

**Verification:**

- When x = 2: (2)² - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 ✓
- When x = 3: (3)² - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 ✓

## Example 3: Explaining Derivatives

**User Query:**
> "What is a derivative and why is it useful?"

**Recommended Response:**

Great question! Let me explain derivatives in a way that makes sense.

**Simple Definition:**
A derivative tells us the **rate of change** of something at any given point.

**Real-World Analogy: Driving a Car**

- **Position** = Where you are (miles from home)
- **Velocity** (derivative of position) = How fast you're going (mph)
- **Acceleration** (derivative of velocity) = How fast your speed is changing

**Visual Understanding:**

```
       y
       |      ___
       |     /
       |    /   ← The derivative at any point
       |   /      is the SLOPE of the tangent line
       |  /
       | /
       |/____________ x
```

**Mathematical Definition:**
The derivative of f(x) is:

```
f'(x) = lim[h→0] (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h
```

**Example:**
For f(x) = x², the derivative is f'(x) = 2x

This means:

- At x = 1, the slope is 2
- At x = 3, the slope is 6
- The curve gets steeper as x increases!

**Why It's Useful:**

1. Finding maximum/minimum values
2. Calculating velocity and acceleration
3. Optimization problems in business
4. Understanding how things change

## Example 4: Geometry Problem

**User Query:**
> "Find the area of a triangle with base 8 cm and height 5 cm"

**Recommended Response:**

Let's find the area of this triangle!

**Formula:**
Area of a triangle = ½ × base × height

**Given:**

- Base (b) = 8 cm
- Height (h) = 5 cm

**Calculation:**

```
Area = ½ × 8 × 5
     = ½ × 40
     = 20 cm²
```

**Answer:** The area is **20 cm²**

**Visual:**

```
        /\
       /  \
      /    \  height = 5 cm
     /      \
    /________\
    base = 8 cm
```

**Why ½?**
A triangle is exactly half of a rectangle with the same base and height!

## Example 5: Word Problem

**User Query:**
> "A train travels 240 miles in 4 hours. What is its average speed?"

**Recommended Response:**

Let's solve this step by step!

**Identify What We Know:**

- Distance traveled = 240 miles
- Time taken = 4 hours
- Speed = ? (what we're looking for)

**Formula:**
Speed = Distance ÷ Time

**Calculation:**

```
Speed = 240 miles ÷ 4 hours
      = 60 miles per hour
```

**Answer:** The train's average speed is **60 mph**

**Check:** If the train goes 60 mph for 4 hours:
60 × 4 = 240 miles ✓

**Pro Tip:** Remember the triangle!

```
    Distance
   ___________
   |         |
   | Speed × Time
```

Cover what you need, and you see the formula!
