# Comedian - Reference Guide

## Comedy Styles & Techniques

### 1. Observational Comedy

Finding humor in everyday situations that everyone can relate to.

**Key Elements:**

- Notice small, overlooked details of daily life
- Point out absurdities in normal behavior
- "Have you ever noticed..." format
- Universal experiences (traffic, technology, relationships)

**Example:**
> "Why do we press harder on the remote control when we know the batteries are dead?"

### 2. Wordplay & Puns

**Types of Puns:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Homophonic | Same sound, different meaning | "I used to be a banker, but I lost interest" |
| Compound | Relies on double meaning | "Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana" |
| Visual | Written puns that work on paper | "I'm reading a book about anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down!" |

### 3. Self-Deprecating Humor

Making yourself the target of jokes in a relatable way.

**Guidelines:**

- Keep it light, not genuinely sad
- Universal flaws (forgetfulness, clumsiness)
- Show confidence behind the self-mockery
- Don't overdo it

**Example:**
> "I'm not saying I'm out of shape, but I get winded scrolling through Netflix."

---

### 4. Absurdist/Surreal Comedy

Humor from illogical, bizarre, or nonsensical situations.

**Techniques:**

- Unexpected juxtapositions
- Logical conclusions from absurd premises
- Breaking reality in funny ways

**Example:**
> "A horse walks into a bar. The bartender asks, 'Why the long face?' The horse, unable to comprehend human language, panics and gallops out, injuring several patrons."

## Joke Structures

### Setup-Punchline

The classic two-part structure.

```
Setup: Creates expectation
Punchline: Subverts expectation
```

**Example:**

- Setup: "I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high."
- Punchline: "She looked surprised."

---

### Rule of Three

Two normal items establish a pattern, the third breaks it.

**Example:**
> "I've learned three things in life: Never argue with idiots, never wrestle with pigs, and never trust a man who owns a ferret."

---

### Misdirection

Lead the audience one direction, then surprise them.

**Example:**
> "I have a lot of growing up to do. I realized that the other day inside my fort."

---

### Callback

Referencing an earlier joke for cumulative effect.

**Usage:**

1. Tell a joke early
2. Wait for other material
3. Reference the first joke unexpectedly

---

### Anti-Joke

Subverts joke expectations entirely.

**Example:**
> "What's brown and sticky? A stick."
> "Why did the chicken cross the road? Because its owner didn't fence the yard properly."

---

## Timing & Delivery

### The Pause

- **Before punchline**: Builds anticipation
- **After punchline**: Lets it land
- **In the middle**: Creates tension

### Commitment

- Believe in your material
- Don't laugh at your own jokes (usually)
- Stay in character if doing a bit

### Reading the Room

- Gauge energy level
- Adjust material to audience
- Know when to move on

---

## Comedy Topics (Safe Zones)

### Always Safe

- Technology struggles
- Everyday inconveniences
- Self-deprecation (mild)
- Universal human experiences
- Food and eating habits
- Pets and animals
- Weather
- Aging (general)

### Approach With Care

- Relationships (keep general)
- Work/career (generic situations)
- Family dynamics (universal themes)

### Avoid

- Personal attacks
- Discriminatory content
- Tragic current events
- Highly divisive topics

## Recovery Techniques

When a joke doesn't land:

1. **Acknowledge it**: "Well, that one's going in the trash"
2. **Callback later**: Use the failed joke as material
3. **Move on quickly**: Don't dwell
4. **Self-deprecate**: "I wrote that one myself, can you tell?"
5. **Blame the audience** (playfully): "This material kills at poetry readings"

| "If X, then Y" | Logical absurdity | "If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you" |
